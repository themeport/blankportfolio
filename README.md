Be sure to click the 'Save Menu' button to save your menu. Blank Portfolio supports most social networks. If we are missing one, you can request new items at https://themeport.net/contact.

## Footer Widgets
To setup the widgets in the footer as seen in our live demo: http://demo.themeport.net/Blank Portfolio/ Go to Appearance > Widgets and you'll see the 'Sidebar' module to add your widgets. The main demo is using 3 text widgets. For best results, we suggest using 3 widgets at most.

## Editing Blank Portfolio
If you would like to edit the footer credit, this is allowed, however, we would highly appreciate keeping some form of theme credit linking back to https://themeport.net. The credit information is located in the footer.php file in the Blank Portfolio theme directory. You will need to use a text editor like Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/. This is our text editor of choice.

If you need of a free text editor, we recommend Atom by GitHub: 
https://atom.io/

For updating any styles, Blank Portfolio uses plain CSS to help keep things simple. We highly recommend adding or modifying any styles by using the built in 'Additional CSS' module that is located under 'Appearance' > 'Customize' > 'Additional CSS'. You can find this in your WordPress dashboard. Adding CSS via the 'Additional CSS' module will prevent any loss of changes when we update Blank Portfolio. If you do not see the 'Additional CSS' module under 'Customize' you may need to update your WordPress install to the latest version.
